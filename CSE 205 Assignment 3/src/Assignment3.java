	/* PUBLIC- As a software engineer, you are responsible for your own work and
	 * software. Consider factors such as physical disabilities, resources and 
	 * economic disadvantages. For example, if you are programming an application 
	 * for a new ride sharing company; you'll have to take account for handicapped 
	 * people with wheel chairs.
	 * 
	 * CLIENT AND EMPLOYER- As a software engineer, you are responsible for 
	 * keeping all confidential information private and only using property/documents 
	 * approved by the client. For example, if you are working for Apple on a 
	 * new feature for a new upcoming phone; you're required to keep it secret until 
	 * the reveal.  
	 * 
	 * PRODUCT- As a software engineer, you must ensure the best and highest quality 
	 * products with a reasonable price and cost. For example, Apple and Samsung are 
	 * always competing for the better quality phone and camera. 
	 * 
	 * JUDGEMENT- As a software engineer, you must maintain integrity and avoid deceptive 
	 * financial practices such as bribery, double billing or other improper financial 
	 * practices. For example, coding a program/virus that steals personal information or
	 * credit card numbers.
	 * 
	 * MANAGEMENT- As a software engineer, you are responsible to lead your fellow engineers 
	 * through correct procedures to finish a project effectively. Ensure realistic 
	 * estimates of cost, scheduling, personnel, quality and outcomes on any project. 
	 * For example, you are the leader of a robotics club and you need someone to code 
	 * in Matlab and you assign someone with little to no knowledge in Matlab. You'd be 
	 * assigning someone that is not suitably qualified.
